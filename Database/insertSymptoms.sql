Taking three or more steps is generally considered to be abnormal, and taking more than five steps is regarded as being clearly abnormal.

Type IV is the first lesion considered advanced in this classification because of the severe intimal disorganization caused by the lipid core. The characteristic core appears to develop from an increase and the consequent confluence of the small isolated pools of extracellular lipid that characterize type III lesions. The increase in lipid is believed to result from continued insudation from the plasma.

The most common presentation is with ascites, but can range from fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) to asymptomatic forms.

Thus, MODY combines characteristics of type 1 diabetes (young age at diagnosis) and type 2 diabetes (less insulin dependence than type 1 diabetes). The term MODY is now most often used to refer to a group of monogenic diseases with these characteristics. Here, the term is used to describe hyperglycemia diagnosed at a young age with no or minor insulin dependency, no evidence of insulin resistence, and lack of evidence of autoimmune destruction of the beta cells.'),

The frontozygomatic bony cleft produces absence of the lateral orbital rim; this border now is formed by the hypoplastic greater wing of the sphenoid. The absence of bony support for the outer canthus produces lateral canthal dystopia and the characteristic antimongoloid slant of the palpebral fissures.

Preauricular hairline indicators delineate the Number 8 cleft as the first of the northbound clefts. Complete absence of the bony lateral orbital wall and rim constitute the skeletal element of the Number 8 cleft.

SP-A and SP-D are hydrophilic proteins that regulate surfactant metabolism and have immunologic functions, whereas SP-B and SP-C are hydrophobic molecules, which play a direct role in the organization of the surfactant structure in the interphase and in the stabilization of the lipid layers during the respiratory cycle.
